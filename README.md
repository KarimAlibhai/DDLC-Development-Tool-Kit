# DDLC-Development-Tool-Kit

The DDLC-Development-Tool-Kit is something I have put together to help make DDLC Modding a lot easier. Currently there are a lot of great tools out there such as the Mood Posing Tool. A custom renpy launcher for DDLC and more. (Credits and links at the end). So I decided to put together a tool kit which has them all linked and wrapped up nicely together. This has helped save me lots of time and I hope it can help save other modders out there some time too! Feel free to contact me if you have any issues!

#Installation instructions:

The tool kit will not work out of the box just yet. You need to follow these setup steps.
1. Download the tool kit.
2. You will need to have a zipped download of DDLC. Official files can be downloaded at http://ddlc.moe
3. Now you'll want to open up the renpy application stored in 'DDMMaker-7.3.5-sdk'. (this is a modified version of renpy).
4. Then open settings to set two things up. 
5. The first is set the location of the zipped version of DDLC, wherever you have it stored, I store mine within the toolkit folder for convinience but it really doesn't matter where you store it. 
6. The second is setting the projects directory. The important thing about the projects directory is that this is where all of your projects will be stored. E.g. I have a project called 'DDPI' in the projects directory, the next files below 'DDPI' are the files for that mod. See the screenshot.
7. Now onto the Mood Posing Tool, if you haven't heard of it, it's an amazing tool which makes adding in different sprites and custom poses much easier. In the credits a link to their post is available for more information. To use the MPT simply place it in the 'mod_assets' folder of your project.
